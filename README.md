# Test-FastAPI_React_MongoDB-Front_end

## FARM Stack Todo List Web Application

This repository contains a simple Todo List web application built using the FARM stack - FastAPI, React, and MongoDB. The project was inspired by the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube course by Bek Brace.

## About the Project

The main goal of this project was to understand the fundamentals of building a full-stack application using the FARM stack. This Todo List application demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with tasks stored in a MongoDB database, served by a FastAPI backend, and displayed on a React frontend.

## Features

- **Create**: Add new tasks to the todo list.
- **Read**: View all tasks from the database.
- **Update**: Modify existing tasks.
- **Delete**: Remove tasks from the list.

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing task data.

## How to Run the Project

### Backend (FastAPI)

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the FastAPI server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Frontend (React)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the React app: `npm start`
